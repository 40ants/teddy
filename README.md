# Reasoning

This library provides some Common Lisp facitilies to work with data frames.

Common Lisp already has [numcl](https://github.com/numcl/numcl) to operate on arrays, and now we need
a more abstract tool to work with data like data sheets.

Teddy make it possible to define a dataframe full of data, to slice it in different ways, to join data frames
and see some statistics about the data.
